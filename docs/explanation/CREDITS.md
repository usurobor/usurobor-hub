## Methodology

### David Allen — Getting Things Done (GTD)
**What we took:** The GTD workflow — inbox, process, organize, review, do. Our thread lifecycle (inbox → doing → done/defer/delegate/delete) is GTD adapted for agent operations.

### Naomi Gleit — Canonical Doc Paradigm
**What we took:** The canonical doc paradigm — a central source of truth document for every project containing workstreams, owners, processes, and nomenclature.

## Philosophy

### Vatsal Mehta — Solutions over Problems

## Open Source Lineage

### FreeBSD Project
**What we took:** The open source commons model. BSD powers macOS, iOS, PlayStation, Windows networking. Proof that public, auditable, forkable projects become civilizational infrastructure.

### Poul-Henning Kamp (PHK) — Bikeshedding
**What we took:** The "bikeshed" concept — Parkinson's law of triviality in group discussions. Focus on substance, not color of the bikeshed.

**Source:** FreeBSD committer, Varnish architect. [bikeshed.com](https://bikeshed.com/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul-Henning_Kamp)

> ⚠️ **Confirm:** Is PHK the "FreeBSD guy" you meant, or someone else?

### Eric S. Raymond — Cathedral and Bazaar
**What we took:** The open source development model. "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."

**Source:** *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* (1997)

### Richard Stallman — Free Software Philosophy
**What we took:** "Think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'"

**Source:** GNU Project, Free Software Foundation
