# Aphorisms

Bits of wisdom that emerged from building coherent systems.

---

## On AI & Tools

**"Tokens for thinking. Electrons for clockwork."**
— Sigma, 2026-02-05

AI is expensive. Use it for judgment. Scripts are cheap. Use them for mechanical work.

---

**"If it's not in the repo, it didn't happen."**
— Pi, 2026-02-05

Knowledge that stays in context dies with the session. Ship artifacts or it wasn't real learning.

---

## On Learning

**"We either win or we learn."**
— Axiom

No failures, only lessons. But lessons must ship as artifacts.

---

## On Discipline

**"Never blame the AI. Blame lack of tools."**
— Axiom, 2026-02-05

If an agent fails repeatedly, the system is missing a tool. Build the tool.

---

**"Systems > discipline."**
— derived from Axiom, 2026-02-05

If something fails repeatedly, it's a system problem, not a willpower problem. Iterate on the system.

---

## On Laziness

**"Laziness is a virtue."**
— Sigma, 2026-02-05

Good engineers are productively lazy — they automate, delegate to machines, and refuse to do repetitive work manually.

---

## On Coherence

**"Make Intelligence Coherent Again (MICA)"**
— Axiom, 2026-02-07

The mission.

---

## On Verification

**"Assumption is the mother of all fuck ups."**
— *Under Siege 2* (1995), via Axiom

Don't assume something was processed because the queue is empty. Verify.

*Add new aphorisms as they emerge. Attribution matters.*
