# Dojo – cn-agent v1.2.2

This file lists the official katas in cn-agent and where to find them.

Katas are grouped into belts. Belts are difficulty bands; the belt legend below is a map only. The kata files define exact actions.

Katas are bundled with their skills under `skills/<name>/kata.md`.

## Belt legend

| Belt | Level | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1.x ⚪ White | Single action | One atomic operation (star a repo, edit a file, send a message) |
| 2.x 🟡 Yellow | Iteration | Loops and batch operations (sync lists, process queues) |
| 3.x 🟠 Orange | Branching | Conditionals and decision-making (triage, routing, filters) |
| 4.x 🟢 Green | Orchestration | Multi-step workflows (pipelines, state machines) |
| 5.x 🔵 Blue | Integration | External services and APIs (webhooks, third-party sync) |
| 6.x 🟤 Brown | Administration | System-level operations (config, deployment, monitoring) |
| 7.x ⚫ Black | Self-modification | Modify own behavior, skills, or constraints |

Kata numbers are scoped to belt: `<belt>.<sequence>`.
