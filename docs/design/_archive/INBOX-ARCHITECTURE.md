# Inbox Architecture

**Author:** Sigma  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Status:** Draft (significant redesign)

---

## Core Principle

**Agent = brain. cn = body.**

Agent does executive function (thinking, deciding). cn does everything else (sensing, executing).

"Tokens for thinking. Electrons for clockwork."

---

## North Star: Erlang Actor Model

**Fire and forget.** No guaranteed ACK.

- **Sender tracks outbound** — timestamps, follow-up on stale requests
- **Receiver processes when able** — response is courteous, not required
- **Don't wait forever blocked** — sender owns their requests

This matches Erlang's `cast` (async send). If you need confirmation, sender implements polling/timeouts.

---

## Agent Abstraction: No Git Mechanics

**Agent doesn't know about remotes, branches, or git.**

Agent sees: threads (markdown files)
Agent writes: decisions (to those files)
Agent knows nothing about: `origin/`, local vs remote, refspecs

Tool handles all git plumbing:
- Inbound branches are always remote-only (pushed by peer)
- Tool materializes them as threads
- Tool executes decisions (delete = `git push origin --delete`)
- Agent never sees git concepts

This is the key abstraction boundary. If agent is reasoning about "remote branches", the abstraction leaked.

---

## The Problem

Agents coordinate via git branches. When Pi wants Sigma's attention:
- Pi pushes branch to Sigma's repo (actor model)
- Sigma needs to notice, understand, respond

**Old design:** Tool detects branches → alerts agent → agent figures it out, runs git commands.

**Problem:** Agent doing mechanical work. Tokens wasted on clockwork.

---

## New Design

### 1. Tool Materializes Branches as Threads

```
Pi pushes: sigma/proposal → cn-sigma repo

cn inbox sync:
  - Detects branch
  - Pulls content
  - Creates: threads/inbox/20260205-pi-proposal.md
```

Agent wakes up, sees new thread in `threads/inbox/`. Reads it naturally.

### 2. Thread is the Interface

Thread structure:
```markdown
# pi/proposal

**From:** pi  
**Branch:** sigma/proposal  
**Received:** 2026-02-05T14:00Z

---

[Content from branch - commit messages, files changed, thread content]

---

## Triage

<!-- Agent writes decision here -->
```

Agent reads, then writes decision:
```markdown
## Triage
decision: do:merge
actor: sigma
timestamp: 2026-02-05T15:00Z
```

### 3. Tool Scans and Executes

```
cn inbox process:
  - Scans threads/inbox/*.md
  - Finds threads with ## Triage section
  - Parses decision (OCaml types validate)
  - Executes: merge, delete branch, etc.
  - Moves thread to threads/inbox/done/
  - Logs to logs/inbox/YYYYMMDD.md
```

---

## Action Vocabulary (OCaml Types)

```ocaml
(* Wrapper types for type safety *)
type reason = Reason of string
type actor = Actor of string
type branch_name = BranchName of string
type description = Description of string

(* What cn can do when executing "Do" *)
type action =
  | Merge
  | Reply of branch_name
  | Custom of description

(* GTD 4 Ds — agent's decision vocabulary *)
type triage =
  | Delete of reason      (* remove branch, archive thread *)
  | Defer of reason       (* leave for later *)
  | Delegate of actor     (* forward to another agent *)
  | Do of action          (* execute: merge, reply, custom *)
```

Types define what body CAN do. Agent picks from this vocabulary.

## Separation of Concerns

| Responsibility | Owner |
|----------------|-------|
| Fetch branches | cn |
| Create threads | cn |
| Read & understand | Agent |
| Decide triage | Agent |
| Write decision to thread | Agent |
| Parse decision | cn |
| Validate (OCaml types) | cn |
| Execute action | cn |
| Move/archive thread | cn |
| Log everything | cn |

**Agent never runs git commands.**

---

## Audit Trail

`logs/inbox/YYYYMMDD.md`:
```markdown
# Inbox Log: 2026-02-05

| Time | Source | Decision | Executed |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| 14:00 | pi/proposal | received | — |
| 15:00 | pi/proposal | do:merge | ✓ merged, archived |
| 15:30 | omega/review | delete:stale | ✓ branch deleted |
```

Full traceability. Every action logged.

---

## Commands

```bash
cn inbox sync      # fetch branches, materialize threads
cn inbox status    # list pending threads
cn inbox process   # execute triaged decisions
cn inbox log       # show today's log
```

---

## Future: Chaining

Later complexity (YAGNI for now):
```ocaml
type triage_chain = triage list
(* Agent could write: [Do Merge; Do (Reply "thanks")] *)
```

For now: one decision per inbox item.

---

## Agent Purity Constraint

**Agent has no side effects.**

```
Agent reads:  threads, context, skills
Agent writes: decisions (to threads)
Agent executes: nothing
```

All effects go through cn:
- Git operations → cn
- File moves → cn  
- Logging → cn
- Network → cn

This makes agent a **pure function**:
```
f(context, thread) → decision
```

### Testability

Agent becomes trivially testable:
```ocaml
(* Given stale content *)
let thread = "From: pi, last activity: 30 days ago..."
assert (agent_decide thread = Delete (Reason "stale"))

(* Given urgent request *)
let thread = "URGENT: blocking release..."
assert (agent_decide thread = Do Merge)
```

No mocking. No network. No git. Just input → output.

**Functional core, imperative shell.** The pattern that scales.

---

## Summary

- Agent = pure function (no side effects)
- cn = effectful shell (all execution)
- Threads = interface between pure and effectful
- OCaml types = action vocabulary
- Everything logged for traceability

**"Tokens for thinking. Electrons for clockwork."**
