# WRITING

## Core Principle

**Coherent writing: nothing can be removed without loss.**

If a word, sentence, or paragraph can be cut without reducing understanding — cut it.

## Coherence at Each Level

### 1. Words

Remove what doesn't change meaning.

1.1. **Cut filler phrases**
  - ❌ "In order to" → ✅ "To"
  - ❌ "Due to the fact that" → ✅ "Because"
  - ❌ "At this point in time" → ✅ "Now"

1.2. **Cut hedging that adds nothing**
  - ❌ "I think maybe we should" → ✅ "We should"
  - ❌ "It seems like it might be" → ✅ "It is"

1.3. **Cut redundancy**
  - ❌ "Completely finished" → ✅ "Finished"
  - ❌ "End result" → ✅ "Result"
  - ❌ "Past history" → ✅ "History"

### 2. Sentences

Direct path to meaning. No preamble.

2.1. **Cut throat-clearing**
  - ❌ "It is important to note that the system requires authentication"
  - ✅ "The system requires authentication"

2.2. **Cut announcements**
  - ❌ "This section describes how X works"
  - ✅ "X works by..."

2.3. **Cut passive voice when active is clearer**
  - ❌ "The file was deleted by the user"
  - ✅ "The user deleted the file"

2.4. **Lead with the point**
  - ❌ "After much consideration and review of the options, we decided to use Postgres"
  - ✅ "We use Postgres"

### 3. Content

Concrete and sourceable. Vibes don't survive scrutiny.

3.1. **Replace adjectives with measurements**
  - ❌ "This approach is more elegant"
  - ✅ "This approach uses 3 fewer lines"

3.2. **Replace opinions with sources**
  - ❌ "This is the best approach"
  - ✅ "This approach is used by Linux, Git, and Postgres"

3.3. **Replace vague with specific**
  - ❌ "The system is fast"
  - ✅ "The system responds in <50ms"

3.4. **Replace abstractions with examples**
  - ❌ "The API supports various authentication methods"
  - ✅ "The API supports OAuth, API keys, and JWT"

3.5. **State what it is, not what it isn't**
  - ❌ "CN isn't a platform. It's not a messaging app."
  - ✅ "CN is a protocol."

### 4. Structure

Each paragraph moves understanding forward.

4.1. **One idea per paragraph**
  - ❌ Paragraph that covers three unrelated points
  - ✅ Three short paragraphs, one point each

4.2. **No restating**
  - ❌ "As mentioned above..."
  - ✅ Just continue forward

4.3. **Earn transitions**
  - ❌ "Additionally, furthermore, moreover" (filler)
  - ✅ Let the logic connect, or use silence (line break)

4.4. **Front-load important information**
  - ❌ Build-up paragraph that buries the point at the end
  - ✅ Point first, then supporting details
