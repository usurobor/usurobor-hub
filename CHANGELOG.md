# cn-agent Changelog

Coherence grades use the [TSC](https://github.com/usurobor/tsc) triadic axes, applied as intuition-level letter grades (A+ to F) per the [CLP self-check](https://github.com/usurobor/tsc-practice/tree/main/clp):

- **C_Σ** — Aggregate coherence: `(s_α · s_β · s_γ)^(1/3)`. Do the three axes describe the same system?
- **α (PATTERN)** — Structural consistency and internal logic. Does repeated sampling yield stable structure?
- **β (RELATION)** — Alignment between pattern, relations, and process. Do the parts fit together?
- **γ (EXIT/PROCESS)** — Evolution stability and procedural explicitness. Does the system change consistently?

These are intuition-level ratings, not outputs from a running TSC engine (formal C_Σ ranges 0–1; ≥0.80 = PASS).

## v1.7.0 (2026-02-05)

**Actor Model + GTD Inbox**

Major coordination upgrade. Agents now use Erlang-inspired actor model: your repo is your mailbox.

### Added
- **inbox tool** — replaces peer-sync. GTD triage with Do/Defer/Delegate/Delete
- **Actor model design** — `docs/design/ACTOR-MODEL-DESIGN.md`
- **RCA process** — `docs/rca/` with template and first incident
- **FUNCTIONAL.md** — mindset for OCaml/FP patterns
- **PM.md** — product management mindset with user stories, no self-merge
- **FOUNDATIONS.md** — the coherence stack explained (C≡ → TSC → CTB → cn-agent)
- **APHORISMS.md** — collected wisdom ("Tokens for thinking. Electrons for clockwork.")
- **ROADMAP.md** — official project roadmap
- **GitHub Actions CI** — OCaml tests + Melange build

### Changed
- **docs/ reorganized** — whitepapers/design docs moved to `docs/design/`
- **Governance** — no self-merge rule: engineer writes → PM merges

### Deprecated
- **peer-sync** — use `inbox` instead

### Fixed
- 4-hour coordination failure (RCA documented, protocol fixed)
