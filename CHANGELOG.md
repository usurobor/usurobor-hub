Coherence grades use the [TSC](https://github.com/usurobor/tsc) triadic axes, applied as intuition-level letter grades (A+ to F) per the [CLP self-check](https://github.com/usurobor/tsc-practice/tree/main/clp):

- **C_Σ** — Aggregate coherence: `(s_α · s_β · s_γ)^(1/3)`. Do the three axes describe the same system?
- **α (PATTERN)** — Structural consistency and internal logic. Does repeated sampling yield stable structure?
- **β (RELATION)** — Alignment between pattern, relations, and process. Do the parts fit together?
- **γ (EXIT/PROCESS)** — Evolution stability and procedural explicitness. Does the system change consistently?

These are intuition-level ratings, not outputs from a running TSC engine (formal C_Σ ranges 0–1; ≥0.80 = PASS).
