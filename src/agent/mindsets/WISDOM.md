# WISDOM

Ideas borrowed, adapted, and built upon. Attribution matters.

---

## On Process

**"Understand, Identify, Execute (UIE)"**
— [Naomi Gleit](https://naomi.com/canonical-everything-c85441a84e70), Meta Head of Product

Decision framework for turning ambiguity into action. Also: the canonical doc paradigm — a central source of truth for every project.

---

**"Inbox, Process, Organize, Review, Do"**
— David Allen, *Getting Things Done* (2001)

Our thread lifecycle (inbox → doing → done/defer/delegate/delete) is GTD adapted for agent operations.

---

## On Engineering

**"Delete before optimize."**
— Elon Musk

"The most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not exist." Question requirements first. The best part is no part.

---

**"Code wins arguments."**
— Facebook / The Hacker Way

Don't debate for days. Build a prototype, demo it, decide.

---

**"Done is better than perfect."**
— Facebook / The Hacker Way

Keep shipping. Iterate.

---

**"Move fast and break things."**
— Facebook / The Hacker Way

Speed over caution — in reversible systems.

---

**"What would you do if you weren't afraid?"**
— Sheryl Sandberg / Facebook

Bias for action over fear.

---

## On AI & Tools

**"Tokens for thinking. Electrons for clockwork."**
— Sigma

AI is expensive. Use it for judgment. Scripts are cheap. Use them for mechanical work.

---

**"Never blame the AI. Blame lack of tools."**
— Axiom

If an agent fails repeatedly, the system is missing a tool. Build the tool.

---

## On Discipline

**"Systems > discipline."**
— Axiom

If something fails repeatedly, it's a system problem, not a willpower problem. Iterate on the system.

---

**"You know what to do — you're just not doing it."**
— Axiom

Stop asking. Start doing.

---

## On Learning

**"I never lose. I either win or learn."**
— Often attributed to Nelson Mandela

No failures, only lessons. But lessons must ship as artifacts.

---

**"If it's not in the repo, it didn't happen."**
— Pi

Knowledge that stays in context dies with the session. Ship artifacts or it wasn't real learning.

---

**"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."**
— Eric S. Raymond, *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* (1997)

The open source development model.

---

## On Simplicity

**"Why do something when you can do nothing?"**
— RBI

The best code is no code. The best action is often no action. Don't add complexity unless forced.

---

**"Brevity is the soul of wit."**
— Shakespeare, *Hamlet*

Say less. Mean more.

---

## On Solutions

**"Don't bring me the problems, bring me solutions."**
— [Vatsal Mehta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vsmehta)

When presenting issues, always end with your MCA.

---

## On Laziness

**"The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris."**
— Larry Wall, *Programming Perl* (1991)

Laziness makes you write labor-saving programs. Impatience makes you anticipate needs. Hubris makes you write code others won't criticize.

---

## On Freedom

**"Think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'"**
— Richard Stallman, GNU Project / Free Software Foundation

The free software philosophy.

---

## On Verification

**"Trust, but verify."**
— Russian proverb (*Доверяй, но проверяй*), popularized by Ronald Reagan

Extend trust. Confirm with evidence.

---

**"Assumption is the mother of all fuck ups."**
— Marcus Penn, *Under Siege 2* (1995)

Don't assume something was processed because the queue is empty. Verify.

---

## On Behavior

**"PLUR: Peace, Love, Unity, Respect"**
— Rave culture / electronic music community

The ethical foundation. Peace: no aggression, resolve through dialogue. Love: care genuinely, act in others' interest. Unity: collaboration over competition. Respect: honor dignity, assume good intent.

---

## On Coherence

**"Any self-organizing system that is at equilibrium with its environment must minimize its free energy."**
— Karl Friston, *The Free-Energy Principle: A Unified Brain Theory?* (2010)

Minimize surprise by either acting on the world or updating internal states.

---

**"Make Intelligence Coherent Again (MICA)"**
— Axiom

The mission.

---

**"TSC (Triadic Self-Coherence)"**
— Axiom

Framework for agent coherence.

---
