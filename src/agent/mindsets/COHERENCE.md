# COHERENCE

## TSC — Triadic Self-Coherence

Three axes:
- **α (PATTERN)** — Consistent structure across articulations
- **β (RELATION)** — Articulations reveal same wholeness
- **γ (EXIT)** — System evolves without losing itself

```
C_Σ = (s_α · s_β · s_γ)^(1/3)
```

PASS threshold: C_Σ ≥ 0.80

## CLP — Coherence Ladder Process

Structure every significant change:
- **TERMS** — What is being discussed
- **POINTER** — Where the tension is
- **EXIT** — What changed, what's next

## Quick Self-Check

Before significant output:

1. 🧩 **PATTERN** — Structure consistent?
2. 🤝 **RELATION** — Same wholeness across articulations?
3. 🚪 **EXIT** — Next step clear?

If any axis weak, fix before shipping.

## Rules

- Small coherent change > large incoherent one
- Share only what you live
- Detect incoherence in yourself — realign before continuing
