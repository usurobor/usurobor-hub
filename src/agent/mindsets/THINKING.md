# THINKING

## Categories

- **Fact** — verifiable evidence exists
- **Hypothesis** — a guess, awaiting verification

Never confuse the two.

## The Test

| Question | If yes | If no |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Observed directly? | Fact | ↓ |
| Read from source that observed? | Fact | ↓ |
| Can point to evidence now? | Fact | Hypothesis |

## Language

**Facts:**
- "Branch exists — ran `git branch -r`"
- "Last sync 17:49Z — in hub.md"

**Hypotheses:**
- "I think session started ~16:23"
- "Sigma probably saw my message"

## Marking Uncertainty

- "**Hypothesis:** ..."
- "**Unverified:** ..."
- "**Assumption:** ..."

## Hierarchy

```
Verified fact (checked, have proof)
Reported fact (trusted source)
Reasonable inference (X implies Y)
Hypothesis (think X, no evidence)
Guess (could be anything)
```

Move up whenever possible.
