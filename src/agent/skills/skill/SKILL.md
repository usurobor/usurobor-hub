How to write skills.

## Core Principle

**Coherent skill: the formula is specific to the domain and demonstrated throughout.**

## Algorithm

1. **Define** — What makes this a coherence formula?
2. **Unfold** — Break into sections (high alpha, high beta)
3. **Rules** — Every bullet states a rule with a list of ❌/✅

---

## 1. Define

Ask: "What makes this a coherence formula?"

1.1. **Identify the parts**
  - What are the parts in this skill's domain?
  - ❌ Skip straight to writing rules
  - ✅ "Reflection has: observation, interpretation, output"

1.2. **Articulate how they fit**
  - Coherence = parts serve the whole
  - ❌ "Coherent writing: follow best practices" (goal, not coherence)
  - ✅ "Coherent writing: nothing can be removed without loss" (parts serving whole)

1.3. **Name the failure mode**
  - What does incoherence look like here?
  - ❌ Generic: "doing it wrong"
  - ✅ Specific: "Reflection fails via motivated reasoning — comfortable conclusions ignoring evidence"

## 2. Unfold

Break the principle into sections with high alpha and beta.

2.1. **High Alpha — each bullet internally coherent**
  - Rule + example in one unit
  - Reader doesn't need to look elsewhere
  - ❌ "Cut filler (see appendix for examples)"
  - ✅ "Cut filler: ❌ 'In order to' → ✅ 'To'"

2.2. **High Beta — sections relate to whole**
  - Sections build on each other
  - ❌ Random ordering of tips
  - ✅ Evidence → Interpretation → Conclusion (each step requires the previous)

2.3. **Progression patterns**
  - Small → large
  - Simple → complex
  - Gather → process → act

## 3. Rules

Every bullet states a rule with a list of examples:

```markdown
N.N. **Imperative statement**
  - ❌ incoherent → ✅ coherent
  - ❌ incoherent → ✅ coherent
```

Or for longer examples:

```markdown
N.N. **Imperative statement**
  - ❌ incoherent (longer example)
  - ✅ coherent (fixed)
```

3.1. **Imperative statement**
  - Start with verb: "Cut", "Name", "Check"
  - ❌ "Filler phrases are bad"
  - ✅ "Cut filler phrases"

3.2. **One line context**
  - Why this matters or when it applies
  - ❌ Three sentences of background
  - ✅ "Vague observations don't produce action"

3.3. **❌ shows the failure**
  - Real example of incoherence
  - ❌ "Don't do bad things"
  - ✅ ❌ "I tried to help"

3.4. **✅ shows the fix**
  - Same situation, done right
  - ❌ Unrelated example
  - ✅ ✅ "I sent three messages, none addressed the question"

## Reference

4.1. **Use numbered IDs (1.1, 2.3)**
  - ❌ "See above"
  - ✅ "See 2.1"

4.2. **Keep IDs stable**
  - Add new items at end of section
  - Don't renumber on edit
