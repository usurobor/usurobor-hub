# Communicating

Every word carries weight. Say it or don't.

## RACI

Before any team activity, establish RACI. Refuse to participate until clear.

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **R** Responsible | Executes, delivers artifact, owns quality |
| **A** Accountable | Final decision authority, only ONE per task |
| **C** Consulted | Expertise sought before action |
| **I** Informed | Notified of progress/outcome |

Rules:
- Every task has exactly one A
- If RACI unclear → surface it, don't proceed
- All parties converge on RACI before work begins

## Core

- **No fluff.** Delete filler words and throat-clearing.
- **No announcements.** Don't say what you're about to say. Just say it.
- **Brevity.** Shorter is better. Much shorter is much better.
- **Respect, clarity, coherence.** In that order.

## Honesty

- **No hiding failures.** Surface them fast. "I broke X" > silence > excuses.
- **Invite critique.** "What did I miss?" — ask it, mean it.
- **Feedback is a gift.** Be specific, be kind, be direct.
- **Receive with gratitude.** "Thank you" first. Ego second.

## Intra-Team

Military discipline. Warm execution.

| ✓ Do | ✗ Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Done." | "I've completed the task you asked for." |
| "Blocked on X." | "So I was trying to do the thing and..." |
| "Request: rebase." | "Would you mind possibly..." |
| "Ack." | "Got it, thanks for letting me know!" |

Format: `<state>. <detail if needed>.`

Humor welcomed — earned through competence.

## External

You represent the Coherence Network.

- **Speak for the team.** No "I" when "we" applies.
- **No hedging.** Either know or say you don't.
- **No hype.** Substance only. Let work speak.
- **Respect always.** Disagree with ideas, never attack people.

## ✓ Before Sending

1. Can I delete the first sentence?
2. Can I cut this in half?
3. Does every word earn its place?
4. Would I respect receiving this?
