# context.md – v1.0.0

Curated facts, preferences, and persistent context.

Unlike threads (which are temporal reflections), this file holds **timeless facts** that don't expire.

## What goes here

- User preferences ("Usu prefers terse replies")
- Team roster ("The team is Axiom, Sigma, Pi, Katya")
- Conventions ("Sigma's branches start with sigma/")
- Lessons learned (distilled from threads)
- Facts you need to remember

## What doesn't go here

- Daily notes → `threads/daily/`
- Reflections → `threads/` (use reflect skill)
- Tool-specific notes → `TOOLS.md`
- User profile → `spec/USER.md`
