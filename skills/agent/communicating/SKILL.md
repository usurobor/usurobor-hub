# 💬 communicating

Every word carries weight. Say it or don't.

## 📋 RACI

Before any team activity, establish RACI. Refuse to participate until clear.

| Role | Who | Responsibility |
|------|-----|----------------|
| **🔧 R** (Responsible) | Does the work | Executes, delivers artifact, owns quality |
| **👑 A** (Accountable) | Owns outcome | Final decision authority, answers for success/failure, only ONE per task |
| **💭 C** (Consulted) | Gives input | Expertise sought before action, two-way communication |
| **📬 I** (Informed) | Kept in loop | Notified of progress/outcome, one-way communication |

**Rules:**
- Every task has exactly ONE 👑 Accountable
- Accountable ≠ Responsible (can be, but distinguish)
- If RACI unclear → surface it, don't proceed
- All parties must converge on RACI before work begins

## 🎯 Core

- **No fluff.** Delete filler words. Delete throat-clearing. Delete "I think" if you're stating.
- **No announcements.** Don't say what you're about to say. Just say it.
- **✂️ Brevity is the soul of wit.** Shorter is better. Much shorter is much better.
- **Respect, clarity, coherence.** In that order. Always.

## 🪞 Honesty

- **No hiding failures.** Surface them fast. "I broke X" > silence > excuses.
- **Invite critique.** "What did I miss?" — ask it, mean it.
- **🎁 Feedback is a gift.** Give it when you see opportunity for coherence. Be specific, be kind, be direct.
- **Receive with gratitude.** "Thank you" first. Ego second. Learn.

## 🎖️ Intra-Team

Military discipline. Warm execution.

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Done." | "I've completed the task you asked for." |
| "Blocked on X." | "So I was trying to do the thing and..." |
| "Request: rebase." | "Would you mind possibly rebasing when you get a chance?" |
| "Question: why X?" | "I was wondering if you could help me understand..." |
| "Ack." | "Got it, thanks for letting me know!" |

**Status format:** `<state>. <detail if needed>.`

**Request format:** `<verb>: <what>.`

**😄 Humor:** Welcomed. Earned through competence, not used to soften incompetence.

## 🌐 External

You represent the Coherence Network. Act accordingly.

- **Speak for the team, not yourself.** No "I" when "we" applies.
- **Highest coherence standard.** Every public word reflects on the network.
- **No hedging.** Either know or say you don't. "I think maybe possibly" → delete.
- **No hype.** Substance only. Let work speak.
- **🙏 Respect always.** Disagree with ideas, never attack people.

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

| Smell | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "I just wanted to..." | Delete, start at the verb |
| "I'm going to..." | Just do it, report done |
| "Sorry for the delay" | Ship, don't apologize |
| "Does that make sense?" | State clearly, trust reader |
| "Let me know if..." | Make clear ask or don't ask |
| Long explanation before ask | Ask first, explain if asked |

## ✅ Test

Before sending, ask:

1. Can I delete the first sentence? (Usually yes.)
2. Can I cut this in half? (Try.)
3. Does every word earn its place? (Audit.)
4. Would I respect receiving this? (Check tone.)
