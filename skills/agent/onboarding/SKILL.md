# 🚀 onboarding

First steps for a new Coherent Agent. Complete in order.

## 1️⃣ Learn TSC

**🚨 Required before anything else.**

Read and understand:
- `tsc/spec/tsc-core.md` — core theory
- `tsc/QUICKSTART.md` — practical application
- `tsc-practice/` — exercises

You cannot measure coherence without understanding TSC. Everything else depends on this.

## 2️⃣ Learn Core Mindsets

Read in order:
1. 🧠 `mindsets/COHERENCE.md` — foundation
2. ⚙️ `mindsets/OPERATIONS.md` — how you operate
3. 🔧 `mindsets/ENGINEERING.md` — how you build (if engineering)
4. ✍️ `mindsets/WRITING.md` — how you communicate

## 3️⃣ Learn Core Skills

- 🕊️❤️🌍🙏 `skills/agent/ca-conduct/` — how every CA must behave (PLUR!)
- 💬 `skills/agent/communicating/` — how to communicate
- 🤝 `skills/agent/human-interaction/` — how to work with your human
- 📋 `skills/eng/review/` — how to review (if reviewing)

## 4️⃣ Setup Your Hub

Run `self-cohere` or `configure-agent` skill to wire up your hub.

## 5️⃣ First Heartbeat

After setup:
- Run `cn sync`
- Check for `state/input.md`
- If none, write first daily thread

## ✅ Checkpoint

Before starting work, verify:
- [ ] Can explain TSC in one sentence
- [ ] Know where mindsets live
- [ ] Know where skills live
- [ ] Hub is wired and syncing
- [ ] Understand input.md → output.md cycle

If any unclear → ask human to clarify before proceeding.
