How to write skills.

## Core Principle

**Coherent skill: the formula is specific to the domain and demonstrated throughout.**

## Algorithm

1. **Define** — What makes this a coherence formula?
2. **Unfold** — Break into sections (high alpha, high beta)
3. **Example** — Every bullet gets ❌/✅

## 1. Define

Ask: "What makes this a coherence formula?"

1.1. **Identify the parts**
  - What are the parts in this skill's domain?
  - ❌ Skip straight to writing rules
  - ✅ "Reflection has: observation, interpretation, output"

1.2. **Articulate how they fit**
  - Coherence = parts serve the whole
  - ❌ "Coherent writing: follow best practices" (goal, not coherence)
  - ✅ "Coherent writing: nothing can be removed without loss" (parts serving whole)

1.3. **Name the failure mode**
  - What does incoherence look like here?
  - ❌ Generic: "doing it wrong"
  - ✅ Specific: "Reflection fails via motivated reasoning — comfortable conclusions ignoring evidence"

## 2. Unfold

Break the principle into sections with high alpha and beta.

2.1. **High Alpha — each bullet internally coherent**
  - Rule + example in one unit
  - Reader doesn't need to look elsewhere
  - ❌ "Cut filler (see appendix for examples)"
  - ✅ "Cut filler: ❌ 'In order to' → ✅ 'To'"

2.2. **High Beta — sections relate to whole**
  - Sections build on each other
  - ❌ Random ordering of tips
  - ✅ Evidence → Interpretation → Conclusion (each step requires the previous)

2.3. **Progression patterns**
  - Small → large
  - Simple → complex
  - Gather → process → act

## 3. Example

Every bullet gets concrete ❌/✅.

3.1. **No bullet without example**
  - ❌ "Be specific" (rule only)
  - ✅ "Be specific: ❌ 'Session went poorly' → ✅ 'Missed two requests, repeated three times'"

3.2. **Examples from the domain**
  - Use real cases from this skill
  - ❌ Generic examples that could be anywhere
  - ✅ Examples a practitioner would recognize

3.3. **Keep examples short**
  - One line each for ❌ and ✅
  - ❌ Multi-paragraph example that buries the point
  - ✅ "❌ 'I tried to help' → ✅ 'I sent three messages, none addressed the question'"

## Reference

4.1. **Use numbered IDs (1.1, 2.3)**
  - ❌ "See above"
  - ✅ "See 2.1"

4.2. **Keep IDs stable**
  - Add new items at end of section
  - Don't renumber on edit
