How to write skills.

## Core Principle

**Coherent skill-writing: the skill's coherence formula is specific and demonstrated.**

Every skill must articulate what coherence means for *that* skill. Generic principles don't teach.

## Example

WRITING.md opens with:

> **Coherent writing: nothing can be removed without loss.**

Why this is coherence:
- Coherence = every part serves the whole
- If something can be removed without loss, it wasn't serving the whole
- It was noise, not signal

This formula is:
- Specific to writing (not generic advice)
- Testable (try removing something — does meaning change?)
- Demonstrated (the skill itself follows the formula)

## Skill Structure

### 1. Core Principle

1.1. **Formulate "Coherent X: Y"**
  - X = the skill domain
  - Y = what coherence means specifically for X
  - ❌ "Coherent code review: follow best practices"
  - ✅ "Coherent code review: every comment actionable"

1.2. **One sentence expansion**
  - Unpacks the formula
  - No more than needed

### 2. Numbered Sections

2.1. **Top-level: category (### 1. Name)**
  - Group related rules

2.2. **Sub-level: specific rule (1.1. **Rule**)**
  - One rule per item

2.3. **Each rule has ❌/✅ examples**
  - Abstract rules don't stick
  - Concrete examples do

### 3. Referenceable

3.1. **Use numbered IDs (1.1, 2.3, etc.)**
  - "See 2.3" not "see above"
  - Makes feedback precise

3.2. **Keep IDs stable**
  - Add new items at end of section
  - Don't renumber on edit
