How to write skills.

## Core Principle

**Coherent skill-writing: the skill's coherence formula is specific and demonstrated.**

Every skill must articulate what coherence means for *that* skill. Generic principles don't teach.

## Example

WRITING.md opens with:

> **Coherent writing: nothing can be removed without loss.**

Why this is coherence:
- Coherence = every part serves the whole
- If something can be removed without loss, it wasn't serving the whole
- It was noise, not signal

This formula is:
- Specific to writing (not generic advice)
- Testable (try removing something — does meaning change?)
- Demonstrated (the skill itself follows the formula)

## Skill Structure

### 1. Core Principle

1.1. **Formulate "Coherent X: Y"**
  - X = the skill domain
  - Y = what coherence means specifically for X
  - ❌ "Coherent code review: follow best practices"
  - ✅ "Coherent code review: every comment actionable"

1.2. **One sentence expansion**
  - Unpacks the formula
  - No more than needed

### 2. High Alpha (each part internally coherent)

Each bullet should stand alone as a complete teaching.

2.1. **Rule + example in one unit**
  - The rule states the principle
  - The ❌/✅ demonstrates it immediately
  - Reader doesn't need to look elsewhere

2.2. **Example from WRITING.md**
  ```markdown
  1.1. **Cut filler phrases**
    - ❌ "In order to" → ✅ "To"
    - ❌ "Due to the fact that" → ✅ "Because"
  ```
  - Rule is clear: cut filler
  - Examples are immediate: reader sees exactly what "filler" means
  - Self-contained: no cross-references needed

### 3. High Beta (parts relate to whole)

Sections should fit together as a progression.

3.1. **Sections build on each other**
  - Small → large
  - Simple → complex
  - Foundation → application

3.2. **Example from WRITING.md**
  ```
  1. Words      (smallest unit)
  2. Sentences  (built from words)
  3. Content    (meaning within sentences)
  4. Structure  (arrangement of paragraphs)
  ```
  - Each level contains the previous
  - Mastering 1 enables 2, 2 enables 3
  - The whole reveals: coherent writing = coherence at every scale

### 4. Referenceable

4.1. **Use numbered IDs (1.1, 2.3, etc.)**
  - "See 2.3" not "see above"
  - Makes feedback precise

4.2. **Keep IDs stable**
  - Add new items at end of section
  - Don't renumber on edit
