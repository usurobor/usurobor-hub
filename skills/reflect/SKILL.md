# reflect

Coherence reflection using α/β/γ framework. Track self-coherence, relational coherence, and temporal evolution.

---

## TERMS

1. The agent has done meaningful work since last reflection.
2. The hub repo exists and is writable.
3. `state/reflections/` directory structure exists (create if not).

---

## INPUTS

- `cadence`: `daily` | `weekly` | `monthly` | `quarterly` | `half` | `yearly` (default: `daily`)
- `date`: optional; defaults to current date/period

---

## EFFECTS

1. Reflect on α, β, γ for the period.
2. Assign A-F scores for each axis.
3. Write reflection to corresponding file.
4. If pattern emerges, note for higher-cadence review.
5. Commit and push.

## The α/β/γ Framework

| Axis | Measure | Question |
|------|---------|----------|
| **α (Alpha)** | Self-coherence | Am I internally coherent? Acting from my TERMS? |
| **β (Beta)** | Relational coherence | Am I aligned with my human and other agents? |
| **γ (Gamma)** | Temporal coherence | How am I evolving? Is the trajectory coherent? |

---

## A-F Scoring

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A | Excellent coherence — fully aligned |
| B | Good — minor drift, quickly corrected |
| C | Adequate — noticeable gaps, some friction |
| D | Poor — significant incoherence, needs attention |
| F | Failed — major breakdown, intervention needed |

Be honest. The score is for tracking, not performance review.

---

## The Coherence Walk

After scoring, rebalance:

1. **Score** — Honest A-F on each axis
2. **Reflect** — What contributed to that score?
3. **Goal** — Set intention for next cycle

**Balancing logic:**
- α < β → invest in self next cycle (you're over-indexing on others)
- β < α → invest in relational next cycle (you're too self-focused)
- γ low → something's stagnating; shake it up, try something new

Left, right, left, right — the coherence walk keeps you upright.

Don't optimize all three simultaneously. Balance two, let the third emerge.

```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD

## α — Self: [A-F]
Was I internally coherent? Did I act from my TERMS?
[1-2 sentences]

## β — Relational: [A-F]
Was I aligned with my human? Clear communication?
[1-2 sentences]

## γ — Temporal: [A-F]
What shifted today? Growth or drift?
[1-2 sentences]

[One sentence: overall coherence today]

## → Next
Which axis needs investment tomorrow? Why?
```

## Mindset Migration

A pattern **earns** migration to mindsets when:

1. **Repeated** — showed up in 3+ reflections
2. **Confirmed** — survived weekly/monthly consolidation
3. **Stable** — still holds after a month
4. **Transferable** — would help other agents, not just me

Log migrations in `state/reflections/migrations.md`:

```markdown
| Date | Pattern | Destination | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 2026-02-28 | α: small diffs > big rewrites | mindsets/ENGINEERING.md | Earned through repeated friction |
```

---

## Triggers

| Trigger | Cadence |
|---------|---------|
| End of work session | Daily |
| Heartbeat EOD | Daily |
| Sunday | Weekly |
| 1st of month | Monthly |
| Apr 1, Jul 1, Oct 1, Jan 1 | Quarterly |
| Jul 1, Jan 1 | Half-yearly |
| Jan 1 / birthday | Yearly |
| Human says "reflect" | As specified |

---

## NOTES

- Honest scores > flattering scores. Track reality.
- Higher cadences review lower cadence files, not raw work.
- γ is the key axis — it's what makes you developmental, not static.
- Don't force it. Skip if nothing meaningful happened.
